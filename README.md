# Sales Analysis
## Overview
In this project I use the Python Pandas library to perform an exploratory analysis on a year of monthly sales reports. After cleaning the data, I use the matplotlib.pyplot library to visualize the data and provide logic for answers to relevant sales questions.

## Questions
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city ordered the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product was ordered the most? Why do you think it was ordered the most?
